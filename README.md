Tools Used:

Balsamiq (site mockup)<br>
Sublime Text Editor

Process:

Look at other great website portfolio examples for ideas.
Create a mockup for About Me site using Balsamiq to have better idea for what my site should look like.
Use Monument index page as template.
Code from there.

Unsolved Problems:
Unable to re-organize nav links when browser shrinks; classes don't work
Tried to have testimonials transition (fade in and fade out) unsuccessfully

Biggest Win:
Was about to use template and change things up without breaking much

Biggest challenge:
Trying to get carousel to work and customizing it
