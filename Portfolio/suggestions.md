## Felix Chow
- Great html setup! I like the use of semantic code to make your site easy to read.
- At the mediaquery breakpoint your header's links are a bit squished and the text over your splash image are a bit wonky, but I'm glad you took a stab at it!
- Great work adding helpful comments to your javascript file!
